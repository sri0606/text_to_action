## Cross Language

This is just a simple demonstration for how to use the `text_to_action` with functions implemented in different languages.

## QuickStart

- **Install dependencies**

  ```python
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- **Run the FastAPI Server**

  ```python
  python server.py
  ```

  The server will be available at http://localhost:8000.

- **Run the Example Scripts**

  - Javascript

  ```
  node main.js
  ```

  - Golang

  ```
  go run main.go
  ```

Feel free to add your own examples with other languages and submit a pull request :)
